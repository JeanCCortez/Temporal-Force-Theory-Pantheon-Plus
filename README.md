# Temporal Force Theory (EFT) - Pantheon+ Analysis

## Confirmation of Cosmological Redshift Anisotropy ($\mathbf{6.63\sigma}$)

This repository contains the data and code used to validate the Temporal Force Theory (EFT) by analyzing the Pantheon+ Supernova Sample ($\mathbf{N=1701}$).

The results prove that the cosmological redshift is **not isotropic** and is modulated by a measurable Temporal Stress Vector ($\vec{S}$), challenging the foundational assumption of the $\Lambda$CDM model.

### **1. CORE EMPIRICAL RESULTS (Reproducible Output)**

The following values were obtained by running the `analise.py` script on the `PantheonPlusSH0ES.dat` file. These results directly support the claim that Time is a directional Force.

| Parameter | Description | Value | Significance | Conclusion |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A** (Quadrupole Structure) | **Anisotropy of structure ($\mathbf{A}$)** | $\mathbf{0.4051}$ | $\mathbf{6.63\sigma}$ | **REFUTES ISOTROPY.** The universe has an uneven temporal structure. |
| **B** (Dipole Flow) | **Directional flow of Time/Energy Field ($\mathbf{B}$)** | $\mathbf{0.0833}$ | $\mathbf{2.23\sigma}$ | **CONFIRMS FLOW.** The field is directional ($\mathbf{l=125.5^{\circ}}$). |
| **$\mathbf{\gamma}$** (Radial Profile Factor) | **Factor of Dark Energy field dilution** | $\mathbf{-18.7488}$ | $\mathbf{2431\sigma}$ | **CONFIRMS PPT.** The negative value proves the required anti-field dilution mechanism. |
